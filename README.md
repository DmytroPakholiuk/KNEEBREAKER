## About this project

So this is a test-task for one company. The overall task was to 
create an app that has "ACL" (Access Control List, a thing in Zend framework
for authorization). The task specified it to have a configuration file for the ACL
and have some sort of role inheritance, so I decided to code this in. It emulates the wat
that Zend Framework may have it done, though RBAC is usually implemented otherwise in Laravel.
